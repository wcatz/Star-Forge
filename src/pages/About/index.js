          <p>Hello, my name is <a href="https://armada-alliance.com/identities/wcat-otg">WCat</a>. I run a totally off
            the grid stakepool using solar panels, batteries and Starlink. I am a founding member of the Armada Alliance
            & spend most of my time helping single stake pool operators run on efficient arm based computers.</p>
          <p>Learn how to run cardano-node on a Raspberry Pi 4 & interact with the blockchain or build a stake pool. My
            image & guide can be found here.

          <p>I have a post that was <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1413841059507998722?s=09">retweeted
            by Charles</a> that I am proud of. I have met so many awesome people, most of which are stake pool
            operators.

          <h1 class="text-4xl mt-4 mb-4">ðŸŒŸ Durability</h1>
          <p>Running a block producer from home allows for the greatest level of security & a few tricks for failover.
            Protected by the latest version of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> and the <a
              rel="nofollow" href="https://www.turris.com/en/omnia/overview/">Turris Omnia</a> the block producer is
            isolated on a seperate vlan with
            it's own 1 Gbps interface connected directly to Starlinks power brick.</p>
          <p>The entire stake pool uses less than 100 watts of electricity, including Starlink!
          </p>
          <p>The original battery I hand built from reclaimed laptop batteries has been retired due to Starlinks
            requirements. The pool now has 22KwH's of LiFePo4 starage and can run for over 15 days without any sunlight.

          <p>The Turris Omnia is an amazing router with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.knot-dns.cz/">Knot

          <h2>OpSec</h2>
          <p>All communication to the M1 Mini core is through Wireguard UDP VPN's. Essentially the pool looks like a
            couple encrypted webcam feeds on the wire. Network failover to a broadband ISP with DDNS updating DNS
            records.</p>
